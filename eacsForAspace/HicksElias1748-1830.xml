In his ministry he promoted unorthodox doctrines that led to controversy, which caused the second major schism within the Religious Society of Friends, the first being the schism caused by George Keith in 1691. He broke with the Philadelphia Friends Yearly meeting and established a separate Christian Quaker meeting. His followers were called "Keithians" or "Christian Quakers."[1] Elias Hicks was the older cousin of the painter Edward Hicks. </p></descriptiveNote></source></sources></control><cpfDescription><identity><entityType>person</entityType><nameEntry><part>Hicks, Elias, 1748-1830</part></nameEntry><entityId>https://viaf.org/viaf/22530221</entityId><entityId>https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n89000087</entityId><entityId>https://id.loc.gov/authorities/n89000087</entityId><entityId>https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q371260</entityId><entityId>http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/http://n2t.net/ark:/99166/w6rj4s40</entityId></identity><description><existDates><dateRange><fromDate standardDate="1748-03-19" localType="Birth">1748-03-19</fromDate><toDate standardDate="1830-02-27" localType="Birth">1830-02-27</toDate></dateRange></existDates><localDescriptions><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Quakers</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Slaves--Emancipation</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Lay ministry--Society of Friends</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Hicksites--19th century</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Society of Friends--History</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Slaveholders</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Quakers--Relations with African Americans</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Sermons, American</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Society of Friends--Sermons</term></localDescription><localDescription localType="associatedSubject"><term>Church controversies--Society of Friends</term></localDescription></localDescriptions><places><place><placeEntry>Oyster Bay (N.Y.)</placeEntry></place><place><placeEntry>New York (State)</placeEntry></place><place><placeEntry>New York</placeEntry></place></places><occupation><term>Farmers</term></occupation><biogHist><biogHist><p xmlns="urn:isbn:1-931666-33-4">Elias Hicks (1748-1830) was an eminent Quaker minister from Jericho, Long Island, N.Y.
