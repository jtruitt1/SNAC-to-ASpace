            "text": "p. 362. Esther Collins and Ann Edwards. More than half a century has elapsed since the whole community was shocked ... by the announcement that these beloved friends were drowned while attempting to cross the Delaware in a carriage on the ice.\r\n\r\np. 370. They left home on the fifth of 2nd month, 1820, accompanied by Nancy Stokes and Henry Warrington, when the awful event occurred which so suddenly terminated their earthly existence.\r\n\r\np. 381-382. Although so little is left on record respecting Ann Edwards, the minutes of Chester Monthly Meeting show, that she was actively engaged in religious service from 1810 to 1818, visiting during that period, Virginia, New York, and Baltimore Yearly Meetings, (the latter three times) and many of the meetings comprising them. The only narrative known to be preserved of any of these journeys, is one of a visit made in 1811, to some of the meetings within Philadelphia Quarterly and Baltimore Yearly Meeting, in which she was accompanied by Esther Collins and Ebenezer Roberts. A brief account kept by E. C., concludes with humble acknowledgment of the loving kindness and tender mercy of a gracious God, extended to them throughout the journey. She had also much service within the limits of her own Yearly Meeting, among Friends and others. In 1811, she visited all the families in Moorestown and its vicinity, who were willing to receive her, which it is believed they all did, with one exception.\r\n\r\nFor many years there was no place of worship in Moorestown, except that of Friends, and many children were running neglected through the streets on First day afternoons. Her heart went out to these in the overflowings of sympathy and Christian love, and at h·er suggestion a First-day school was established for their benefit, taught by members of our Society, and others who attended our meeting. This was continued for several years till an attempt was made to open it with formal prayer, which occasioned the withdrawal of some of the teachers, and its final discontinuance. About that period in the history of the Society of Friends, several such schools were organized in and around Philadelphia; and elderly Friends now living remember them as useful institutions, which exerted a healthful influence over a much neglected class of children. It was then customary in the families of Friends (and we hope the same good practice is still maintained by very many) for the heads of families to gather the younger members around them for religious reading, during portions of the First day of the week. thus exercising that parental control and oversight, which properly belongs to their position.\r\n\r\nFirst-day schools, as now conducted in other religious societies, and in too many cases among Friends also, are connected with practices inconsistent with the principles given to\r\nour Society to uphold, and occupy a position very unlike that held by the schools in which Ann Edwards and other Friends of her day wore interested. In her ministry, which was in the demonstration of the spirit, she bore a full testimony to the divinity, and various offices of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in prayer seemed to have near access to the throne of grace.\r\n\r\nHaving indulged in much gayety of attire before joining in membership with Friends, she afterwards felt constrained to practise great simplicity, and her path was for a time exceedingly narrow in this and other respects; believing some restraints of a peculiar character to be laid upon her, as a trial of her faith, and test of obedience, which were afterwards removed. Her family, though treating her, with kindness, not being able to feel with her at this time. rendered her exercises more trying. In 1815, her sister Elizabeth Edwards, was also received into membership with Friends. Though not called to much active service in the church, she was concerned in conduct and conversation, to adorn the doctrine she professed, and is remembered as a, most agreeable companion, being one of those bright, cheerful spirits, who carry sunshine wherever they go.\r\n\r\nIn the Quarterly meeting held at Haddonfield in the 3rd month following the removal of Esther Collins and Ann Edwards, Elizabeth Evans (then Barton), and a member of that meeting, in a remarkable communication repeated the following lines, in reference to the feeling which evidently pervaded the meeting. on account of the loss the church had sustained.",

                        "text": "p. 362. Esther Collins and Ann Edwards. More than half a century has elapsed since the whole community was shocked ... by the announcement that these beloved friends were drowned while attempting to cross the Delaware in a carriage on the ice.\r\n\r\np. 370. They left home on the fifth of 2nd month, 1820, accompanied by Nancy Stokes and Henry Warrington, when the awful event occurred which so suddenly terminated their earthly existence.\r\n\r\np. 381-382. Although so little is left on record respecting Ann Edwards, the minutes of Chester Monthly Meeting show, that she was actively engaged in religious service from 1810 to 1818, visiting during that period, Virginia, New York, and Baltimore Yearly Meetings, (the latter three times) and many of the meetings comprising them. The only narrative known to be preserved of any of these journeys, is one of a visit made in 1811, to some of the meetings within Philadelphia Quarterly and Baltimore Yearly Meeting, in which she was accompanied by Esther Collins and Ebenezer Roberts. A brief account kept by E. C., concludes with humble acknowledgment of the loving kindness and tender mercy of a gracious God, extended to them throughout the journey. She had also much service within the limits of her own Yearly Meeting, among Friends and others. In 1811, she visited all the families in Moorestown and its vicinity, who were willing to receive her, which it is believed they all did, with one exception.\r\n\r\nFor many years there was no place of worship in Moorestown, except that of Friends, and many children were running neglected through the streets on First day afternoons. Her heart went out to these in the overflowings of sympathy and Christian love, and at h·er suggestion a First-day school was established for their benefit, taught by members of our Society, and others who attended our meeting. This was continued for several years till an attempt was made to open it with formal prayer, which occasioned the withdrawal of some of the teachers, and its final discontinuance. About that period in the history of the Society of Friends, several such schools were organized in and around Philadelphia; and elderly Friends now living remember them as useful institutions, which exerted a healthful influence over a much neglected class of children. It was then customary in the families of Friends (and we hope the same good practice is still maintained by very many) for the heads of families to gather the younger members around them for religious reading, during portions of the First day of the week. thus exercising that parental control and oversight, which properly belongs to their position.\r\n\r\nFirst-day schools, as now conducted in other religious societies, and in too many cases among Friends also, are connected with practices inconsistent with the principles given to\r\nour Society to uphold, and occupy a position very unlike that held by the schools in which Ann Edwards and other Friends of her day wore interested. In her ministry, which was in the demonstration of the spirit, she bore a full testimony to the divinity, and various offices of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in prayer seemed to have near access to the throne of grace.\r\n\r\nHaving indulged in much gayety of attire before joining in membership with Friends, she afterwards felt constrained to practise great simplicity, and her path was for a time exceedingly narrow in this and other respects; believing some restraints of a peculiar character to be laid upon her, as a trial of her faith, and test of obedience, which were afterwards removed. Her family, though treating her, with kindness, not being able to feel with her at this time. rendered her exercises more trying. In 1815, her sister Elizabeth Edwards, was also received into membership with Friends. Though not called to much active service in the church, she was concerned in conduct and conversation, to adorn the doctrine she professed, and is remembered as a, most agreeable companion, being one of those bright, cheerful spirits, who carry sunshine wherever they go.\r\n\r\nIn the Quarterly meeting held at Haddonfield in the 3rd month following the removal of Esther Collins and Ann Edwards, Elizabeth Evans (then Barton), and a member of that meeting, in a remarkable communication repeated the following lines, in reference to the feeling which evidently pervaded the meeting. on account of the loss the church had sustained.",
