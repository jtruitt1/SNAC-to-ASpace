He received a Quaker education, and was apprenticed as a tanner. Following the completion of his apprenticeship his faith lapsed. Then, in 1778, following a meeting for burial at the Merion Friends Meeting House, Merion, Pennsylvania, he experienced a deep religious transformation that changed his life. He married a religious fellow-Quaker, Sarah Evans, that year and in 1781 he was acknowledged as a minister.</p>",

Educated in local schools, Savery was then apprenticed in the tanning industry. He was a business Friend of Philadelphia and a prominent minister. In 1778, he married Sarah Evans. Savery was first recognized a minister in 1781, and traveled on religious visits throughout America and Europe. In 1796, Savery traveled to England via Germany, France, and the Netherlands. He went on to visit Scotland and Ireland while on the same trip. Soon after returning to the United States, Savery became ill. He died on June 19, 1804, in Philadelphia.</p>\r\n<citation xmlns=\"urn:isbn:1-931666-33-4\"> From the description of the William Savery diaries, 1794-1798.

It contains correspondence between extended Sharpless family relations including Sharpless, Hunn, Jones, Drinker families and journals of Joshua Sharpless, a Quaker minister who worked with Native Americans and visited Quaker meetings in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Canada. Correspondence covers various topics including the travels of women ministers, yellow fever, and contemporary events. The second series contains primarily nineteenth century correspondence of the extended family of Townsend and Mary Brinton (Jones) Sharpless. It includes letters written by Henry H. G. Sharpless during his European tour and extensive correspondence received by Ezekiel Hunn who served briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War.",
