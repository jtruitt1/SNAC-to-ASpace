            "text": "Jacob Lindley was a male Quaker minister from Chester County, Pennsylvania. Lindley was born in New Garden to Jonathan and Deborah (Halliday) Lindley in November 1744. He became active in the ministry around 1774, and advocated non-violence during the American Revolutionary War. Lindley also worked for temperance and the rights of African Americans. In addition, he was involved in the Society of Friends' work with Native Americans and took part in the 1793 Sandusky River Council. In 1783 Lindley married Quaker minister Hannah Miller, the daughter of James and Rebecca Kirk Miller and widow of William Miller. Hannah died of Yellow Fever in 1798, and after two years Jacob was remarried to Ruth Anna Rutter, also a Quaker minister, in 1800. Jacob Lindley died in 1814 after being thrown from a carriage.",

The families were united by the marriage in 1816 of Nathaniel Richardson and Hannah Yarnall of Byberry. Of special significance are the diaries of Quaker ministers Peter Yarnall (1754-1798) and his second wife, Hannah Haines Thornton Yarnall (1765-1822) and their correspondence with family and fellow ministers. The papers reflect the daily life and concerns of members of two prominent families in southeastern Pennsylvania from the 18th through much of the 20th centuries.",
