            "text": "FORSTER, William (1784-1854). William Forster, the second son of William and Elizabeth Forster, was born at Tottenham on 23 March 1784. \"He was from his childhood sensible of the convictions of the Holy Spirit\" and first spoke in the ministry in the summer of 1803, being recorded about two years later. For the next ten years he was engaged with little intermission in religious visits throughout Great Britain and Ireland, including (in 1812) a visit to the Hebrides and Western Isles. In 1816 he married Anna Buxton, daughter of Thomas Powell Buxton, and settled at Bredpole near Bridport. In 1820 he was liberated for service in North America, on which he was absent more than five years. In 1837 he removed to Norwich and among the religious visits he paid in the following years were Ireland (1843), Normandy (1844, 1845), Indiana (1846). In the winter of 1846-47 he was concerned for the relief of the famine in Ireland. He was one of the Friends who undertook to present the Address of Y.M. 1849 on the Slave Trade to the Sovereigns and other authorities in Europe. In 1852 he paid a visit to the descendants of the Vaudeis in the valleys of Piedment. \r\nFollowing the decision of Y.M. 1852 to appoint a deputation to the Present of the USA on the slave trade, he embarked in September of that year with his brother Josiah, John Candler and William Holmes. After seeing the president, they travelled through many of the southern and western states. After visits to Friends at Hickory Grace and Friendsville, Tennessee, he was taken ill early in January 1854, dying on the 27th of that month, in his 70th year. His body was buried at Friendsville. His publications include: A Christian exhortation to sailors... republished London, 1819. and A salutation of Gosepl love to those in the islands of the Pacific Ocean... published London, 1860... He was a warm friend of Joseph John Gurney. ",

In 1816, he married  Anna Buxton, daughter of Thomas Towell and Anna Buxton and settled at Bredpole near Bridport. The couple had a son named William Edward in 1818. In the first ten years of his ministry, Forster engaged in religious visits throughout Great Britain and Ireland. In 1820, he spent five years in service in North America and then in 1837 he removed to Norwich. In the following years, he paid religious visits to Ireland, Normandy, and Indiana. He was one of the Friends who undertook to present the Address of Y.M. 1849 on the Slave Trade to the Sovereigns and other authorities in Europe. Forster died on January 27 1854 in his 70th year. His body was buried at Friendsville. Forster’s publications include: A Christian exhortation to sailors (published in 1819) and A salutation of Gospel love to those in the islands of the Pacific Ocean (published in 1860).\r\n",
